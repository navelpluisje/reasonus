              While visiting
              <a href="https://www.gearnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.gearnews.com</a>
              I ran into a logo they use which states: Human Made Content. As I am not against AI, but also am not a big
              fan for reasons. I've read the post about why they use this. It in the first paragraph in particular that
              drew my attention:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              More and more content is appearing worldwide that is automatically generated by AI tools and published
              without final review. We are clearly opposed to this trend: On the one hand, for reputational reasons. On
              the other, because we are aware that while AI tools have advantages, they also pose a threat to musicians
              who earn their living through their craft.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              How does this apply to ReaSonus? Well, all posts and documentation are written without the use of AI.
              Probably the grammar and spelling of some of the articles already gave that away.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what about the code?, I hear you think. Well actually the same. I use, as a test, AI for programming
              during my daytime job, but beside some autocomplete that comes in handy, I would not let it write more
              then tests. I'm just not a big fan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is there no AI used at all? Yes a bit. As C++ is not my programming mother tongue, and the errors thrown
              sometimes look like gibberish to me, I use AI to explain the error. That has helped me a couple of times.
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to the logo, I was granted by the owners of Gearnews to use the logo.</p>
